    Discord webhook configuration, here you can configure the private webhook
    that will store all your images and below you can optionally make public
    webhooks for certain apps/social networks.

    In case you don't know how to create a webhook, we recommend that you read
    the documentation or watch the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc

    If you will use public webhooks, create a new channel for each config,
    remember that the main Config.Webhook should be private.
