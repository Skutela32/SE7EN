# KQ_DYNO INSTALLATION GUIDE

This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the KQ_DYNO script for FiveM. 

## Step 1:
After downloading the script, unzip the folder and place it in the `resources` directory on your FiveM server.

## Step 2:
Open the `config.lua` file in the script folder and make sure that the correct framework is enabled.

## Step 3:
After the config file has been set up, add the script to your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that it's added **after** your framework of choice, so that it loads and starts properly.

## Step 4:
Configure your dyno locations in the `config.lua` file

## Done
Enjoy the script


## Extra info
To restart the script. Use our custom `/kq_dyno_restart` command. Simply restarting or ensuring it will cause you to crash
due to the custom props being unloaded from the memory.
